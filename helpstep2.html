<p>This NACA airfoil series is controlled by 4 digits e.g. NACA 2412, which designate the camber, 
   position of the maximum camber and thickness. If an airfoil number is NACA MPXX e.g. NACA 2412
   then:
   M is the maximum camber divided by 100. In the example M=2 so the camber is 0.02 or 2% of the chord. 
   P is the position of the maximum camber divided by 10. In the example P=4 so the maximum camber is at 0.4 or 40% of the chord.
   XX is the thickness divided by 100. In the example XX=12 so the thiickness is 0.12 or 12% of the chord.</p>
